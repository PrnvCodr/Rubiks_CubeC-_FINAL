# Rubik's Cube Cracker

A high-performance, OpenGL-rendered Rubik‚Äôs Cube simulator and solver written in C++. This application features both a **fast solver** (Thistlethwaite's algorithm) and an **optimal solver** (Korf‚Äôs algorithm) capable of finding minimal move solutions (20 moves or fewer). Built from the ground up with custom rendering and solving logic, it's a complete virtual cube experience for enthusiasts and speedcubers alike.

## üîÑ Controls & Shortcuts

- **Face Rotations:**  
  Use `U`, `D`, `L`, `R`, `F`, `B` for clockwise twists of the Up, Down, Left, Right, Front, and Back faces respectively.  
  - Hold `Shift` for counter-clockwise  
  - Hold `Alt` for 180¬∞ twists

- **Cube Rotation (View):**  
  - Arrow Keys for rotating the cube around X and Y axes  
  - `Z` to rotate around Z-axis (`Shift + Z` for inverse)

- **Slice Moves:**  
  - `M`, `E`, `S` for respective middle layer slices

- **Solving & Scrambling:**  
  - `F1`: Fast solve using Thistlethwaite's algorithm  
  - `F2`: Optimal solve using Korf's algorithm  
  - `F5`: Apply a 100-move scramble

## üßä Rendering Engine

- **OpenGL-Based**: Custom renderer with handcrafted visuals and animations.
- **SLERP Animations**: Face rotations are interpolated using quaternions for smooth transitions.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Implements a Phong-style shading model with specular highlights and simulated imperfections on stickers.
- **Visual Effects**: Floating animation for added visual flair.

## üß† Optimal Solver (Korf‚Äôs Algorithm)

The optimal solver is based on **Richard Korf's IDA*** (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm, a classic AI approach used to find **the shortest possible solution** for the Rubik‚Äôs Cube‚Äîguaranteed to be 20 moves or fewer.

### How It Works:

1. **State Encoding**: The cube state is encoded using a compact representation with permutation and orientation data.
2. **Heuristic Lookup**: Heuristics are generated from **precomputed pattern databases**, which give the estimated distance (in moves) to the solved state.
3. **IDA* Search**: A depth-limited DFS is run iteratively, expanding the search only if the heuristic plus the current path cost is within a threshold. The threshold increases gradually.
4. **Optimality**: The heuristic is **admissible and consistent**, ensuring that the solution found is always the shortest possible.

### Pattern Databases Used:

- **Corners Database**: Stores positions and orientations of all 8 corners.
- **Two Edge Databases**: Each stores states for a 7-edge subset for efficiency.
- **Full Edge Permutations**: Captures all permutations of the 12 edge pieces.

### Memory Footprint:

- Total DB size: ~758MB
- Extremely fast due to perfect hashing with **Lehmer codes**, ensuring fast cube state lookups with zero collisions.

## ‚ö° Fast Solver (Thistlethwaite‚Äôs Algorithm)

Thistlethwaite‚Äôs algorithm provides a **fast and practical solution** by reducing the problem into progressively simpler stages using group theory.

### How It Works:

1. The Rubik‚Äôs Cube is viewed as a mathematical group with defined states and allowable moves.
2. Instead of solving the entire cube in one go, the algorithm **moves the cube through a series of subgroups**, each with stricter constraints on allowable moves.
3. At each stage, only a subset of moves is permitted, reducing complexity and allowing **efficient lookup and pruning**.
4. Once the cube enters the final group (where only half-turns are allowed), it's only a few moves away from solved.

### Why It‚Äôs Fast:

- By limiting the search space at each stage, the algorithm avoids checking irrelevant moves.
- Uses **breadth-first searches with precomputed lookup tables** to determine the shortest path to the next group.
- Often solves the cube in **30‚Äì45 moves**, and does so in a fraction of a second.

Unlike Korf‚Äôs algorithm, Thistlethwaite does not guarantee the shortest solution, but it is significantly faster and ideal for interactive use.
